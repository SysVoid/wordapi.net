# Word API

This is an API that allows the retrieval of word lists based on parameters such as:

- Length
- Prefix
- Suffix

In the future, the API will solve anagrams, sub-anagrams and boggle-style matrices.

It currently uses the [SOWPODS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collins_Scrabble_Words) dictionary. The dictionary currently holds approximately 270,000 words.

API Requirements:

- ~~Check word validity~~
- ~~Word list of n length~~
- ~~Word list of n prefix~~
- ~~Word list of n suffix~~
- ~~Performance test Trie vs Array in lists route~~
- ~~Performance test Suffix Trie vs Array in list route~~
- Get anagrams and sub-anagrams of a word
- Solve a boggle-style grid of letters
