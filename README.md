# Word API

This API allows you (The User!) to fish out those words at the tip of your tongue using the following parameters:

- Fish for words based on Letter Length
- Fish for words using Prefixes
- Fish for words using Suffixes

But this is only the beginning! 

Sometime, maybe in the near-future, this API will help you solve Anagrams, Sub-Anagrams and Boggle Style Matrices.

The words fished for in this API all stem from the SOWPODS dictionary. That's **270,000** words to find!

What are you waiting for?

GO FISH!
